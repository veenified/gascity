// defaultWorkPrefix is the id-prefix segment beads.MemStore mints under by
// default ("gc-<n>", memstore.go Create) — the kit's stand-in for a rig/HQ work
// scope's EffectivePrefix. It is deliberately NOT a reserved class prefix
// (config.IsReservedClassPrefix("gc") is false), so a work store and a
// coordination-class store are prefix-disjoint the same way a real split city
// is: every relocated-class bead carries a reserved class prefix, no work bead
// does.
const defaultWorkPrefix = "gc"

// NewSplitStores returns a prefix-disjoint strict (work, graph) store pair for
// split-store tests in beads-level consumers (internal/convoy,
// internal/molecule, internal/dispatch, ...). It is the LEAF construction —
// no policy or class wrapping — so the kit stays importable from internal
// packages; callers that need the compile-time class seam wrap the leaves in
// beads.WorkStore / beads.GraphStore themselves.
//
// Store shapes:
//
//   - work mints "gc-<n>" on BdSemantics: a graph-prefixed create and a dep on
//     a graph bead are hard errors, the way bd fails them.
//   - graph mints under config.ReservedClassPrefix(config.BeadClassGraph)
//     ("gcg-<n>") on SQLiteSemantics, FENCED to the graph class's reserved
//     namespaces: a foreign-prefix pinned create is REFUSED with
//     beads.ErrPinnedIDOutsideNamespace, the way the real binding refuses it,
//     while a cross-store dep is ACCEPTED and recorded as a residence violation
//     that fails the test at cleanup unless the fixture claims it. It honors
//     explicit in-prefix ids, so production-shaped wisp ids (gcg-wisp-*)
//     round-trip, and exposes IDPrefix() == "gcg" for storeref prefix routing.
//
// The asymmetry is the point: these two stores really do run on different
// backends, and a pair that answered the same way would misrepresent one of
// them. See the package doc's rule table.
//
// Graph is the pair's coordination class because it is the one the live
// incidents happened in; NewClassStore builds the same strict leaf for any
// other relocated class.

// NewClassStore returns a strict store leaf for a relocated coordination class,
// keyed by the class itself (config.BeadClassGraph, BeadClassMessaging,
// BeadClassSessions, BeadClassOrders, BeadClassNudges) rather than by a
// hardcoded prefix. config.ReservedClassPrefix is the single source of truth for
// which prefix a class mints under, so a class that gains, loses, or changes its
// reserved prefix moves this kit with it.
//
// A class with no reserved prefix — config.BeadClassWork, whose beads stay on
// bd/Dolt under a rig/HQ EffectivePrefix — fails the test: its ids are
// indistinguishable from work ids, so there is no namespace for the residence
// invariant to be about. Use NewWorkStore for those.
//
// The leaf runs on SQLiteSemantics, because that is what serves a relocated
// class in production: internal/storebinding/sqlite/beads_engine.go OpenEngine
// opens beads.OpenSQLiteStore with the class's reserved prefix. A cross-store
// dep is therefore ACCEPTED and recorded, not rejected — see the package doc's
// rule table and TakeResidenceViolations.
//
// It is also FENCED to config.ReservedClassPrefixesFor(class), because that same
// OpenEngine passes storebinding.EngineReservedPrefixes into the store option: a
// pinned id outside the namespaces the binding claims is refused with
// beads.ErrPinnedIDOutsideNamespace under either semantics. The class's mint
// prefix is only the first of those namespaces — nudges, for one, holds the
// nudge queue's prefix as well and never mints under it — so the fence is the
// whole set, not the mint alone. Migration copies keep their foreign ids through
// beads.ForeignIDCreator, which the fence deliberately leaves open.
