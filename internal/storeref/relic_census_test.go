// The relic census, and the direction it is allowed to be wrong in.
//
// HasLegacyResidents is the half of the retirement condition that a
// point-in-time read answers, so every row here is really about one question:
// when the census cannot see clearly, which way does it fall? True keeps the
// probe and costs one Get per out-of-namespace by-id read. False retires the
// probe and strands every bead the migration carried across under its original
// id — the ga-axin6 shape. The error rows are therefore not edge cases; they
// are the point.
