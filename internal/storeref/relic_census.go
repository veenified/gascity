// The relic census: does this binding still hold a bead that only a probe can
// find?
//
// A class migration copies rows across with their ORIGINAL ids
// (beads.ForeignIDCreator), so a converged city's binding holds a population of
// work-shaped ids no reader can locate from the id alone. That population is
// the whole reason ClassBinding.HasLegacyResidents exists, and it is a
// LIVE-STATE question, not a config or manifest one: the migration manifest
// records what was copied, not what is still open, and relics close over the
// following weeks. A recorded number would be stale the day after it was
// written — "no status files — query live state".
//
// So the answer is one read of the binding, taken once per process, and it is
// deliberately allowed to be wrong in exactly one direction. Reporting relics
// that have since closed keeps a probe one process longer. Reporting clean when
// the read failed retires the probe over beads that are still there.
//
// The once-per-process part rests on one premise: no relic ARRIVES while the
// process runs. That holds because the only thing that creates one is `gc
// storage migrate`, which refuses to run against a city with a live controller
// (cmd/gc/infra_class_migrate.go, guarded by
// TestEnsureInfraClassMigratedRefusesWhileAnotherControllerIsLive). If that
// refusal is ever relaxed, this verdict has to be recomputed on migrate rather
// than taken once at boot.
