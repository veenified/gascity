//
// `sql` and `query` are the two ad-hoc ones: both take an expression an
// operator or agent wrote by hand, both resolve it against the bd ledger alone,
// and both answer no-match with an empty result and exit 0.
//
// `list`, `ready` and `search` are here for the same reason and they were the
// ones that took longest to see, because the flag the id arrives through does
// not look like an id position. `gc bd list --metadata-field
// gc.root_bead_id=<gcg root>` answered `[]` with exit 0 on a converged split
// city: --metadata-field is not id-VALUED, so the by-id door in cmd_bd_by_id.go
// correctly declined it (a quoted id decides nothing about ownership), and bd
// then ran the projection successfully against the one ledger that holds no
// gcg- row. The value named an id but the VERB is a PROJECTION over a class
// this ledger cannot see, and a projection that cannot see a class must fail
// loudly rather than answer with the empty set. That is the whole of ga-iaj7k's
// Invariant 0, and it is what makes `list` COHERENT with `dep tree` — which
// answers a relocated id from the store that holds it, rather than emptily from
// the one that does not. Two projections over the same data with opposite
// failure semantics is worse than either one alone, because an operator who
// learned the loud one trusts the quiet one.
//
// `search` is the same projection over the same flag: bd registers
// --metadata-field for it too, and it answers no-match with `[]` and exit 0.
// Guarding `list` alone would have minted the asymmetry it retired — one verb
// over, on the same molecule, through the same selector. It shares `list`'s
// scan because it shares bd's selector dialect, so the negatives that keep a
// free-text search answerable hold for both unchanged.
//
// `ready` takes --metadata-field as well but is NOT here: it is refused by
// topology instead, in bdRelocatedClassBlindVerbs, which strictly subsumes what
// this scan would have caught for it. See there for why. `list` stays here
// because its selectors span this ledger's own rows — except when it carries
// --ready, which is not a selector at all but a switch onto the same frontier
// query, and is refused by the same topology arm.
//
// The other verbs are unguarded because they are no longer blind, not because
// they were ever safe:
//
//   - `show`, `update` (including `--claim`), `release-if-current`, `dep list`
//     and `dep tree` are answered IN PROCESS from the binding their class is
//     served from — cmd_bd_by_id.go, wired into doBd immediately after this
//     scan — so they never reach the subprocess for a bead the binding holds.
//   - Spellings of those verbs the in-process arm does not implement — `dep tree
//     --show-all-paths`, `--status`, `--format`, `--direction=both` — are
//     REFUSED there (exit 1, naming the bead and the binding) rather than
//     forwarded, because serving them by dropping the flag would answer a
//     different question than the one asked.
//   - Every other bd subcommand that ADDRESSES a reserved-prefix id — in a
//     positional or an id-valued flag — is refused there too WHEN THE BINDING
//     HOLDS IT. A clean binding miss falls through to this ledger, which is
//     then the id's truth: a rig may be configured with a prefix inside the
//     reserved namespace, so the namespace names an authority rather than an
//     exclusive holder.
//
// The selector surface is COMPLETE, and that is checkable rather than hopeful:
// --metadata-field — the only bd flag whose value side is a key=value predicate
// on a read — is registered on exactly three subcommands (list.go, ready.go,
// search.go in the pinned beads module), and every one of them is refused by
// this map or by bdRelocatedClassBlindVerbs.
// TestBdRelocatedClassGuardCoversEverySelectorVerb pins that against bdflags so
// a fourth cannot appear unguarded.

//
// # Why `ready` is here and bare `list` is not
//
// The selector guard above classifies TEXT: it fires when an argument names a
// relocated id namespace in an id-shaped position, because that is the case
// where the empty answer is provably wrong for the predicate that was asked.
// That is the right trigger for `list` and `search`, whose selectors span the
// whole ledger — `bd list --status open` is a question about the rows THIS
// ledger holds and bd answers it correctly.
//
// `ready` is not that shape. It computes a FRONTIER — "the claimable work in
// this store" — and takes no selector that could reach another store, so on a
// city that serves a coordination class from a binding its result is the
// work-class subset of the city's ready set, short by exactly the beads the
// split moved, for every invocation. Measured on a converged split city, `gc
// ready` returned 9 beads including 3 graph-resident ones and matched the API
// id-for-id, while `gc bd ready` returned 5 with none of them, exit 0 — and it
// still returned exit 0 with the relocated binding chmod-000, which is the
// state a loud failure exists for (ga-jbn6f). Scanning argv would have guarded
// the rare `gc bd ready --metadata-field gc.root_bead_id=<gcg root>` and left
// the bare `gc bd ready` — the invocation an operator types, and the one the
// original report measured — answering short and quiet. So the trigger is the
// class assignment in [storage.classes]: a fact about the city, checked before
// any argument is read.
//
// The topology trigger strictly subsumes the selector one for this verb, which
// is why `ready` was removed from bdRelocatedClassGuardedVerbs rather than
// added here alongside it — two triggers for one verb, where one always fires
// first, is a dead branch that reads as coverage.
//
// A city that relocates nothing has no entry to match against, so a
// single-store `gc bd ready` is byte-identical: same argv, same bd binary, same
// exit code. bdSQLRelocatedClassRefusal returns early on an empty relocated
// set, before this map is consulted at all.
//
// Not guarded here: a `ready` hidden behind an unrecognized root flag, which
// bdRelocatedClassVerb cannot locate. That case already fails closed for TEXT
// (every dialect scan runs over the remaining arguments), and bd itself rejects
// the unknown flag before running anything, so the invocation cannot produce a
// short answer either way.

// one verb over: bd registers --ready on `list` as "Show only ready issues (no
// active blockers, same semantics as bd ready)" (cmd/bd/list.go), and it
// dispatches to the same GetReadyWork store methods `bd ready` calls. So it
// computes the identical short frontier over the identical one ledger, exits 0,
// and does so with the relocated binding unreadable — the state ga-jbn6f exists
// for. An operator refused on `gc bd ready` who retried with `gc bd list
// --ready` would have got the confident short answer back.
